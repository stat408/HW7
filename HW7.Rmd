Techsmith relay [http://ato.montana.edu/technologies/techsmith/](http://ato.montana.edu/technologies/techsmith/), is a screen capture video recording software that is free for students. Record a ~ 1 minute video screen capture that includes you talking about a figure created from the dataset you are using for your project.

### Q2. (6 points)

Write a function called activity() to determine what activity to do based on the temperature. The function takes the following input:

- temperature in Farenheit

and then based on the temperature outputs

- < 0: Sit by Fire

- 0 - 40: Ski

- >40 - 70: Bike

- >70 : Raft

To verify your function works, run the following code chunks (known as unit tests)

```{r, eval = F}
activity(-5)

activity(40)

activity(71)

```
